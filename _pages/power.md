<h3>Can We Study <i>Power</i> Scientifically?</h3>

Science is systematic: It is carried out according to fixed methods. Science is about testable hypotheses: It can be tested either by observation or experimentation. Because of the inclusiveness of such definition, a great number of fields can be studied scientifically, including political science and one of its core concepts, power. To discuss its connection to science, we first define the rather ambiguous term. 

<br><br><br>

In this discussion, <i>power</i> is the capacity to cause change. That is, the potential to influence others. Note that the potential does not bring about definite consequences – the influencee has no need to conform nor regard. The term is well-defined but broad: A sovereign or country has power over civilians; an organization or a person has power in a specific context (e.g. a university or a professor). Interestingly, students have power over an institution if they are dissatisfied with something that they aim to change. Moreover, a natural force like darkness has power over individuals as it equally possesses the potential to alter their course of actions. Here we limit our discussion to societal and political power. 

<br><br><br>

In terms of scale, we have the macroscopic power that interacts, for example, between a country and its people, and the microscopic power (which could aid our understanding of the macroscopic level) that interacts between fewer number of individuals, as we will show by notable scientific experiments. We start with the macroscopic level. How is it possible to consider it science while such power is exceedingly magnificent and abstract? 

<br><br><br>

<b>The macroscopic level</b>

<br><br>

Marx, in his theory of power, first lists the forms of division of labor and forms of property. Then he claims that the diverse means of production lead to different relations of production, and such relations shape the superstructure in terms of societal and political interactions. One may question: Is the theory testable and falsifiable at all? Is it scientific? 

<br><br><br>

It might appear that all what Marx say is mere assertion. Yet, we note that Gaventa, in Power and Powerlessness, provides a response that quite fits our context. Gaventa proposes potential scientific methods that could be used to study, for example, what the power structure will be without a specified means or relations of production. Gaventa realizes the problem with his own theory as well. In his third dimension of power, for example, he claims that the nature of power comes through shaping the consciousness of the ones under power. Yet, in terms of testing theories, how can we know what will happen otherwise, and how can we know how an individual's "interests and values" are influenced? 

<br><br><br>

As an example, on the latter question, one may say: Isn't it true that people’s interests have already been deviated under power? We first clear up this doubt. We need to notice the fact that one is under power X does not mean his decision ceases to represent the correct interest, because we have no information on the party (or environment) Y if the individual is not influenced by X. In fact, Y could be equally evil as X. What we are confident is that he applies the knowledge he possesses and most likely trusts to make informed judgments – and here comes our scientific approach. Gaventa claims that we can look at "non-actors" and "non-leaders" in their full lives in a time-consuming manner to see how power exercises change, and to see if power barriers preclude the development of action or consciousness. We can observe, by using such methods, how people make informed choices given specified information under different power levels. 

<br><br><br>

Subsequently, we can verify, or instead, falsify relevant theories with the rigorous approach. 
Although such endeavor is time-consuming and painstaking, it is by no means non-scientific. The theories are testable in systematic ways. As Van Evera and the scientific community well point out, we have two ways to test a theory: Large statistical analysis, and case analysis. By Gaventa’s methodological considerations, the latter will be more beneficial. It is important to note that the latter method is a perfectly valid approach as, for example, in wars (e.g. WWI and WWII) and American politics which are analogous to our study of power. "In-depth case studies yield important data that is otherwise inaccessible."

<br><br><br>

<b>The microscopic level</b>

<br><br>

On a microscopic level, we can use rigorous scientific methods to study diverse issues (people's adaptability, endurance, etc.) of power, as exemplified by the notorious yet notable Stanford Prison Experiment. Professor Zimbardo divides participants into guards and prisoners, and all participants adapted to the roles well above Zimbardo’s imagination: The guards begin to impose authoritarian measures to mentally torture the prisoners, and many of whom accept them. This behavioral preference to the situational attribution (instead of innate or dispositional attribution), as well as similarly, the surprising obedience to authority even if it causes extreme pain by the Milgram Experiment, could well extend to the macroscopic level of power – People will conform to, adapt to, and well accept authoritative power quickly. 

<br><br><br>

We see that we can study how people behave under power, or even how power originates in some circumstances, by manipulating and controlling different variables in a relatively microscopic level to achieve precise data. Furthermore, we can use these data to make further inferences onto the macroscopic level, and we will find out that the two levels are strongly cohesive. We should note that there exist a number of ethical, time, and space constraints to study certain topics on power. Nevertheless, we are able to endeavor to use either experiments or observations to test our testable hypotheses.
