<h3>Objection to Hume’s Position on the Argumentative Circle</h3>
<font size="3">
Richard Pang, in 2016
</font>

<br /><br />

<p class="medium">
<font size="3">

Let us consider <i>a matter of fact</i> X. Hume’s skepticism in his <i>Enquiry</i>, that even if X has been true numerous times in the past, we still cannot be certain that X will be true the next time, seems well-accepted. In other words, he claims that matters of fact come from inductive inferences, and that based on past matters of fact, we can never reasonably infer unobserved ones. 

<br /><br /><br />

As we will explain in detail in the following paragraph, Hume believes that there should be a medium for inductive inferences, and the medium is the uniformity of nature that has to be proved by our very induction, which leads him to conclude that there is <i>no</i> rational foundation for inductive inference. Yet, is the medium necessary? Can it be a reasonable inductive inference <i>without the medium at all</i>? By doubting the status of the medium, we may come up with inspirations that approach the "dilemma of the argumentative circle" in a distinctive way. As will be discussed, <b>the inductive inference does not need a medium</b>. Even though we are not certain of the validity and soundness of our logic of the inductive inference, it is nevertheless rational, and it is wisest to explain our past conformities and repetitions (of a specified matter of fact) by our hypothesized laws and theories of the nature. 

<br /><br /><br />

<b>Hume’s position – the argumentative circle</b>

<br /><br />

Hume is motivated by his stream of thoughts to consider: What is our foundation for deriving our conclusions from experience? That is, between the past experiences and our inference on unobserved ones, a medium is necessary to serve as a bridge to connect. Then, what medium justifies inductive inference? In other words, what exactly is that bridge? Hume responds: There is no rational foundation or basis for inductive inferences. To best explain his arguments, we consider the example of bread in his text. The inductive argument should be as follows. 1) All bread one has eaten was nourishing; 2) Medium; 3) All bread one eats will be nourishing. We can see that we need the medium, which we call the <i>uniformity of nature</i>, to prove the inductive inference: 2.1) At an arbitrary point in the past, the futures (which we have already observed) resembled the past; 2.2) Now or at an arbitrary point in the future, the futures (which we have not observed) will also resemble the past. Now, the argumentative circle becomes extraordinarily clear! In order for the above arguments to be true, we would use the uniformity of nature to prove the inductive inference, and we would also use the inductive inference to prove the uniformity of nature. Subsequently, based on this circle, Hume arrives at his conclusion: There is no rational basis for inductive inference. 
	
<br /><br /><br />

<b>However...</b>

<br /><br />

Let us consider: do we need a medium at all? Is it possible that Hume was stuck inside his very assumption (which is rather arbitrary) that we must need a medium, and that he offers his final proposition without even considering whether his assumption is helpful, or, on the other hand, destructive to his arguments, thus blinding him from the truth? Here we claim that we do not need a medium – The process from observing past regularities to inferring unobserved future acts as the very logic of inductive reasoning (that is, as in the numbered arguments in the previous paragraph, we jump from 1) directly to 3), and we acquired this logic from nature. Before going deep into explaining this logic, we first quickly refute some objections that may come to mind quickly.

<br /><br /><br />
	
Some may doubt: Isn’t it the case that the above logic is claiming that "it might work" precisely because "it worked before"? In other words, didn’t the above logic have the basis that we have observed it to be true? Then, why does the future necessarily follow the past? We have two responses to this doubt. We first analyze the critics’ arguments as follows: 1) Past inductions work; 2) Medium (which is exactly the same as 2.1 and 2.2 above); 3) Future inductions will work. We clearly see that the critics still have not jumped out of the argumentative circle Hume proposes – the very logic we aim to object and surpass: We propose that we do not need the medium. Our second response to the critics’ objection by no means contradicts with our first response: It is possible even if our logic on induction holds, we simply did not realize it until some experience – realizing the logic after sufficient experience does not necessarily mean that it comes from experience. It may, instead, be a law of nature that we have not previously realized but nevertheless keeps existing. 

<br /><br /><br />

Here it is worth taking some effort qualifying our logic on inductive inferences (without the medium as contrary to Hume’s arguments). It is crucial to note that our logic involves one single step – from experiences of the past, directly to inferences of the future, and we do not care about its soundness. In other words, we defined this logic on induction without being certain of its truth. Let us consider one counter-example – an inductive logic related to probability. i) The frequency of trait X in a large sample S from the population U is r; ii) Then the frequency of X in U is about r. The appearance of the two arguments seems to follow our logic of induction rather well, but under scrutiny, we will firmly rule out the probability argument from the logic which we endorse. 

<br /><br /><br />

We will explain succinctly why they are far from our logic. According to Maher (1991), there exists one main problem for probability analysis – we often have kept so many steps between i) and ii) (as in the previous paragraph) unsaid. And among these necessary steps, there exist two arguments that match the sample with the population: a) If our total evidence is that S is a large sample, then the probability that S matches the population is about 1; b) Thus, if our total evidence is that S is a large sample and the proportion of S that has trait X is r, then the probability that S matches the population is about 1. However, argument a) does not necessarily reach b). The addition of one premise in b) (of the uniformity of nature) may ruin the induction: According to Mahor’s rigorous mathematical proof, inductive inferences are rational only if the a priori probability that nature is uniform is not too small. In other words, the uniformity of nature still does serve as a medium, and this probability argument is not at all a part of the logic we endorse. 
We should therefore assert that a logic is the one that we endorse only if there are no intermediate steps from past experiences to future inferences. 

<br /><br /><br />

Yet, as we will show now, although Mahor is correct in eliminating the probability reasoning from our category, he is incorrect in using the word "rational" in his conclusion. We may find it challenging to find ways to prove such logic, or we may even find it erroneous or unprovable; however, this complication by no means implies that our logic is irrational. 


<br /><br /><br />

We understand being rational as being conscious, sane, and sensible – contrast to relying on feelings, passions, or emotions. The logic we endorse starts from the past – the observed conformities and regularities that exhibit a rather strong pattern, to the future – certain hypotheses of a law of nature that does not restrict to one point in either location or time, which we derive from the strong patterns we observed. We think that the past conformities can be generalized, and that this logic is the best explanation to the numerous past regularities. 

<br /><br /><br />

The next step, then, is to test our hypotheses. Yet, it does not matter what our testing result is – It is legitimate to say that our ability to make such predictions precisely owes to the fact that we are using reasons (contrast to passions). In other words, the logic, without being certain of its validity or soundness, is nevertheless rational where “rational” is as we defined in the previous paragraph. Even if our logic on induction is misleading, or can never be successfully tested nor objected, we are undoubtedly rational when making our hypotheses of the laws of nature based on past experience. 

<br /><br /><br />

To summarize, after we have made clear, assisted by a counter-example, the logic of induction that we endorse, we find that even though we may encounter numerous difficulties if we wipe out the component of "medium" in an inductive inference, we may nevertheless acquire valuable inspirations that approach the problem of induction in a distinctive way. Without knowing the clear path for testing our logic, one thing indisputable is that we are certain after our discussion that there does exist a rational basis for inductive reasoning. Yet, the soundness of such inductive reasoning requires more meditations.
