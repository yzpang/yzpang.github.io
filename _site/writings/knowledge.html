<h3>Oedipus' <i>Unconscious Knowledge</i>: Is it Really Ignorance?</h3>
<font size="3">
Richard Pang, in 2015
</font>

<br /><br />

<p class="medium">
<font size="3">


Aristotle views that "tragedy [aims at representing men as] better than in actual life." Indeed, in the play Oedipus the King, it appears to the general public that Oedipus is not grievously flawed, and that he is morally innocent. As Knox also noted, Oedipus is a man of goodness: "Such is the character of Oedipus: he is a great man, a man of experience and swift courageous action, who yet acts only after careful deliberation, illuminated by an analytic and demanding intelligence."

<br /><br /><br />

On this view, what makes the story tragic is precisely such goodness, and more innately, the ignorance that he does not realize his identity. Even though when Oedipus tries to avoid the prophecy by escaping from Corinth, for example, he by no means can escape from his hideous fate thus not killing his father. Even though he might be avoiding his marriage, similarly, the result comes at the opposite end. According to this view, consequently, it is rather evident that it is not his actions to blame on. Instead, it is his hideous fate to lament on because of his complete ignorance – his unfortunate lack of knowledge. 

<br /><br /><br />

Yet, as discussed below, if we pause to reflect, we will realize that it is far too imprudent to make such assumption of Oedipus' ignorance. Accordingly, when the assumption of Oedipus' utter ignorance is challenged or shattered, the consequences of such epistemic position – our interpretations of the story and judgments about Oedipus – will change dramatically.

<br /><br /><br />

To start with, the original assumption of Oedipus' ignorance should be questioned. How could Oedipus, a man of experience, intelligence, and lucid awareness of his questionable background – or he would not run away from Corinth – not mindful of the fact that the age of the man he kills matches his father's, and that the age of the woman he marries well fits his mother's? This question, however, is not an absolute denunciation to ignorance, because what Oedipus possesses, instead, is the <i>unconscious knowledge</i> whose relationship with ignorance is rather complex and is awaiting to be inquired on. As we will see below, the introduction of the unconscious knowledge implies that the initial state when Oedipus has not realized his identity does not indicate that he does not possess the knowledge. The state when Oedipus has realized his identity, accordingly, does not mean that he has learned knowledge. 

<br /><br /><br />

When analyzing the relationship between two concepts – in our case, unconscious knowledge and ignorance – there will be at least two possibilities. Each possibility has a direct impact on further interpretations of the story. Whether Oedipus is blameful is one of the most important questions significantly impacted by our skepticism of our initial assumption. The first possible relationship is similar to our original assumption: Unconscious knowledge is equivalent to total ignorance. According to this view, Oedipus under the utter lack of knowledge is blameless. He therefore suddenly learns the knowledge of everything about his identity, thus making the play a tragedy. 

<br /><br /><br />

"I heard Apollo’s word, and I ran, tried to flee a universe from Corinth… I traveled to a place where three roads meet... As his carriage passed, he cracked his two-pronged goad down on my head and I swiftly smashed my walking stick square across his shoulders, he spun headlong out of his carriage, and I killed every last one of them, there and then." This interpretation would make Oedipus' lack of knowledge an excuse that exonerates him from killing his father. It is an objective fact that the old man is his father, while it is his deficient subjective knowledge that the man is a total stranger. However, besides the previous reasoning that it is hard for Oedipus to not know the old man at all, it is reasonable to question: Is it really the lack of knowledge? Or is it the lack of access to knowledge which we assume it too quickly as the outright lack of knowledge?

<br /><br /><br />

This inquiry leads to the second possible relationship: unconscious knowledge is not ignorance. It is not accessible to Oedipus. Yet, it is in every way influencing his actions. On this view, as the knowledge, though unconscious, is an integral part of Oedipus’ mind that leads to his every decision, it is reasonable to conclude that Oedipus is indeed blameful. This possible relationship, first of all, implies that Oedipus always possesses the knowledge. The moment he discovers his identity is the moment he connects to the unconscious knowledge that is inherently in his mind.

<br /><br /><br />

This theory of unconscious knowledge draws a considerably close similarity to the notion of knowledge in the Socratic dialogue <i>Meno</i> written by Plato. To thoroughly talk about the much-debated question – how people acquire virtue, Socrates and Meno first plan to inquire into the definition of virtue. Yet, before the inquiry starts, Meno challenges Socrates by his paradox of knowledge: "How will you look for it, Socrates, when you do not know at all what it is?"  Socrates, however, believes that knowledge is inherently in the human mind, and he goes on a demonstration with the help of Meno's slave. Prodded by Socrates' question of geometry, the slave who has never learned geometry comes to recognize the correct solution to a geometric problem. In this process, the knowledge the slave has realized is by no means previously absent from his mind. Instead, it is what he already knows, and it is inherently in the human soul. Such process of realization is simply recollection (anamnesis) as noted by Socrates.

<br /><br /><br />

Then if the truth about reality is always in our soul, the soul would be immortal so that you should always confidently try to seek out and recollect what you do not know at present – that is, what you do not recollect? 

<br /><br /><br />

Meno is recollecting his prior knowledge lying deep down his mind instead of developing new concepts previously nonexistent in his mind. Similarly, Oedipus possesses the blindness of the seeing eyes: He does not have direct access to the knowledge that is always in his mind. When he realizes his identity, subsequently, is the moment he recollects his existing knowledge previously unconscious to him.
The relationship we are discussing – unconscious knowledge is not ignorance – furthermore, leads to the conclusion that the underlying unconscious knowledge well influences his behaviors, thus making him blameful for killing his father and marrying his mother.

<br /><br /><br />

"I damn the killer, whoever he may be, an unknown man, or one of many. May he suffer and die, pain beyond pain. I damn myself, if I should come to know that he shares my hearth and home – then I call this curse to fall on me." When read with the rest of the play for a second time, this very segment of Oedipus’ speech to the public is worth noting not only because it foreshadows the future plot, but also because as shown in the later half of the quote, despite its function as persuading the public of his firmness of imminent actions, Oedipus somehow takes note of such possibility of his dreadful identity. The huge abruptness of this segment implies the effect of Oedipus’ unconscious knowledge of his identity underlying his mind. This very effect, together with the fact that unconscious knowledge is a component of his mind, leads to the interpretation that Oedipus is blameful for his actions.

<br /><br /><br />

Yet here remains a lingering question: is there a possibility that some of the unconscious knowledge influences his actions in every way, whereas the rest of it – the portion which lies on the very verge of his psyche – is barely a factor of any of his actions? While we are certainly not negating our second relationship that has just been discussed, it is worth noting that we may lack the complex model of analyzing the exact influence of unconscious knowledge. 

<br /><br /><br />

Yet, we can never easily neglect or jump through this intricacy. Instead, the deeper analysis of the nature of unconscious knowledge can be treated as an important aid to interpret the consequences of it, and whether Oedipus is blameful is amongst them. Though we are on our way to deeper analyses, there is one thing we are sure: It is far too imprudent to make the invalid assumption of Oedipus' ignorance.
